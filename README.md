# Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to understand
overall business performance, sales trends, and profitability.

The analysis was performed using SQL for data querying,
Python for exploratory analysis, and Power BI for dashboard visualization.

---

## Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- GitHub

---

## SQL Work

In SQL, I designed the database structure and performed
data cleaning before starting the analysis.

Key steps included:

- Database and table creation
- Handling null values
- Removing invalid records
- KPI calculations (Revenue, Profit, Orders)
- Category-wise sales analysis
- Region performance analysis
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Profit margin calculation
- Product ranking using window functions

All SQL scripts are organized in separate files
for better readability and modular analysis.

## Python Analysis

Using Python, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to validate SQL findings and explore deeper trends.

Tasks performed:

- Data loading using Pandas
- Data cleaning validation
- Category and product analysis
- Monthly sales visualization
- Revenue and profit trend charts

Python helped in visual storytelling
and pattern identification.

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI
to visualize business performance.

Dashboard includes:

- KPI Cards (Revenue, Profit, Orders, Margin %)
- Category-wise sales chart
- Regional performance donut chart
- Monthly revenue & profit trend
- Top-selling products table
- Interactive slicers for filtering

A dark executive theme was used
to give the dashboard a professional look.

## Challenges Faced

Handling null values and ensuring data accuracy
were key challenges during the cleaning phase.

Designing a dark-themed dashboard while maintaining
visual clarity and readability also required
multiple styling adjustments.

## Key Insights

- Electronics category generated the highest revenue
- A small group of products contributed majority sales
- Monthly sales showed a steady growth trend
- Certain regions underperformed in profit contribution
- High-demand categories drove overall revenue growth
